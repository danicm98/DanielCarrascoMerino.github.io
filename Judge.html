				<h2>What did i do?</h2>
				<p>
					In this project I participated as programmer and designer.Among the tasks that I carried out were the following.
					<li>Movement and animations</li>
					<p>The character's movement is inspired by the movement of the Gears of War saga, in which the player moves towards where the camera is looking, dodges, etc.</p>
					<li>Abilities with GAS (Gameplay ability system)</li>
					<p>In short development I have implemented the system of life, stamina and the main weapon that, as in the movie,
						 will have 7 different types of shots and in which for now there are only two implemented, the basic one and 
						 the piercing with more damage and is capable of 
						break walls. As well as the gun's bullets, the charger and a secondary charger.</p>
