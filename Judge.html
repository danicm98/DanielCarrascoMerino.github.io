				<h2>What did i do?</h2>
				<p>
					In this project I participated as programmer and designer.Among the tasks that I carried out were the following.
					<li>Movement and animations</li>
					<p>The character's movement is inspired by the movement of the Gears of War saga, in which the player moves towards where the camera is looking, dodges, etc.</p>
					<li>Abilities with GAS (Gameplay ability system)</li>
					<p>In short development I have implemented the system of life, stamina and the main weapon that, as in the movie,
						 will have 7 different types of shots and in which for now there are only two implemented, the basic one and 
						 the piercing with more damage and is capable of 
						break walls. As well as the gun's bullets, the charger and a secondary charger. </p>

					<li>Grab system</li>
					<p>This system allows the player to grab enemies and use them as a shield.The grabbed 
						enemy will lose life over time, we can also execute it whenever we want.We can also 
						shoot while grabbing the enemy.Tools like Motion Warping or Aim Offset are used in
						 this system. </p>

					<li>Cover system</li>
					<p>The cover system will allow us to take cover behind walls of different sizes, 
						we will also be able to shoot from the corners and we will be able to lean 
						out of small walls to shoot from them. Later it will be improved by making 
						use of the Distance Matching tool. </p>

					<li>Enemy AI</li>
					<p>So far a basic AI has been developed for the enemies that allows them to
						 detect the player by sight and sound using the AI Perception tool, once 
						 the player is detected the enemy will either shoot or look for cover from
						  where it will peek out to shoot again, all this using the EQS tool. </p>
